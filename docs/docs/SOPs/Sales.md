### SOP-SALES-009: Discount Authorization & Application

**SOP TITLE:** Discount Authorization & Application  
**SOP CODE:** SOP-SALES-009  
**VERSION:** 1.1  
**Updated:** January 13, 2026 (verified UltimatePOS discount config & tax behavior)

1. PURPOSE  
To ensure discounts are applied consistently, only when authorized/pre-configured, and in a way that maintains correct tax/VAT calculation. Protects revenue while allowing promotional flexibility.

2. SCOPE  

WHO:  
• Cashier (for auto-applied or approved discounts)  
• Shop Manager/Owner (for configuration & manual approvals)

WHEN:  
• During sales where discount eligibility exists (promotion, regular customer, etc.)

WHERE:  
• Sales counter / POS

3. RESPONSIBILITY  

| ROLE              | RESPONSIBILITY                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| CASHIER           | Apply pre-configured discounts only; escalate manual requests |
| SHOP MANAGER/OWNER| Configure discounts; approve one-off/manual discounts |

4. DEFINITIONS  

• **Pre-Configured Discount:** Auto-applied via Sell > Discounts (brand/category/location-based)  
• **Ad-Hoc/Manual Discount:** Applied directly on POS screen during transaction  
• **Authorization:** Pre-setup by Manager or explicit approval for manual cases

5. REQUIRED TOOLS / SYSTEMS  
• UltimatePOS system  
• Sell > Discounts menu (for config)  
• Manager approval for manual cases

6. PROCEDURE (Step-by-Step)

STEP 1: Identify Discount Eligibility  
ACTION: Check if sale qualifies for discount.  
DETAIL:  
• Look for pre-configured promos (auto-apply on matching brand/category/location).  
• If customer requests manual discount → escalate to Manager.  
SYSTEM: POS screen (discount shows automatically if configured)  
⚠ CRITICAL: Do NOT apply manual discounts on POS screen unless Manager-approved and tested.

STEP 2: Prefer Pre-Configured Discounts  
ACTION: Rely on system auto-application.  
DETAIL:  
• Pre-configured discounts (set by Manager) apply automatically and correctly recalculate tax/VAT (discount before tax).  
• No cashier action needed — verify discount appears on POS total.  
SYSTEM: N/A (auto)  
⚠ CRITICAL: Ad-hoc discounts added directly on POS cash register screen during live transaction often cause tax miscalculation (tax on original amount, not discounted). Avoid this method.

STEP 3: Configure New/Targeted Discounts (Manager/Owner Only)  
ACTION: Add discount via Sell menu.  
DETAIL:  
1. Go to **Sell > Discounts** → Click **Add** (top right).  
2. Fill fields:  
   - **Name:** e.g., "Bolt 10% Jan Promo"  
   - **Brand:** e.g., Bolt, Geekvape  
   - **Category:** e.g., Disposable, Juices  
   - **Location:** Vape Garage (required)  
   - **Priority:** Higher number wins on overlaps (e.g., 10 > 5)  
   - **Discount Type:** Fixed or Percentage  
   - **Discount Amount:** e.g., 10 (for %)  
   - **Starts At / Ends At:** Date range  
   - **Selling Price Group:** All/Default or specific  
   - **Apply in customer groups:** Optional  
   - **Is active:** ON  
3. Save → Test sale to confirm auto-apply & correct tax.  
SYSTEM: Sell > Discounts  

STEP 4: Handle Manual/One-Off Requests  
ACTION: Escalate to Manager.  
DETAIL:  
• Inform customer discount requires approval.  
• Manager decides (approve/refuse) → If approved, Manager applies or instructs cashier (test tax after).  
SYSTEM: POS (manual entry if approved)  
⚠ CRITICAL: Manual POS discounts risk tax errors — use only as last resort.

STEP 5: Confirm & Complete Sale  
ACTION: Verify discount/tax on POS/invoice.  
DETAIL:  
• Confirm reduced total & tax with customer.  
• Proceed to payment/receipt.  
SYSTEM: POS → Print receipt (shows discount)  
⚠ CRITICAL: If tax looks wrong → void & re-test with pre-configured method.

✓ COMPLETION CHECKLIST  
• Eligibility checked (auto or manual)  
• Pre-configured preferred & verified  
• Manual escalated/approved only  
• Tax & total correct on screen/invoice  
• Receipt shows discount
