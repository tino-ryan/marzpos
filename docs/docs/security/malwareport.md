✔ Local project confirmed clean

**Evidence:** [Insert screenshot or log reference here]

### 4.3 Public Site Reputation Check

**Tool:** Google Safe Browsing / Google Transparency Report  
**Purpose:** Check if the domain is blacklisted or flagged for malware

**Result:**  
✔ “No unsafe content found”  
✔ Domain not flagged by Google

**Evidence:** [Insert screenshot or link reference here]

### 4.4 Dependency Vulnerability Audit

**Command:** `composer audit`  
**Purpose:** Identify vulnerabilities in PHP/Laravel packages with known CVEs.

**Findings:**  
❗ Multiple vulnerabilities detected across 10 packages  
Severity levels: Medium, High, Critical  

Critical libraries include:  
- phenx/php-svg-lib (RCE risk)  
- phpoffice/phpspreadsheet (XXE / SSRF risk)

**Action Required:**  
- Update affected packages to recommended secure versions  
- Test changes in local/staging before live deployment  
- Actions to be performed after site operational on server

**Post-Update Status:**  
Following the execution of `composer update`, which upgraded outdated and high-risk dependencies, security vulnerabilities were reduced from **33 issues in 10 packages** to **1 remaining vulnerability impacting only 1 package**.

**Evidence:** [Insert before/after composer audit screenshots here]

### 4.5 Dependency Integrity Check

**Command:** `composer validate`  

**Findings:**  
⚠ Warnings:  
- `composer.lock` not up to date  
- ❌ Missing required package: `myfatoorah/laravel-package`  
- ⚠ Hard-coded version constraints preventing security updates  

**Root Cause:**  
Manual edits to `composer.json` without updating dependencies

**Recommended Fixes:**  
```bash
composer require myfatoorah/laravel-package
composer update --with-all-dependencies
